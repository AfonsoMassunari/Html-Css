                    <p class="first_p">Hunter × Hunter (ハンター×ハンター, Hantā × Hantā), pronounced "Hunter Hunter", is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi with two anime adaptations. The first chapter of the Hunter × Hunter manga series was published in March 1998, in Weekly Shōnen Jump.</p>
                    <p>The story of Hunter × Hunter focuses on a young boy named Gon Freecss, who one day discovers that the father he has always been told was dead is alive and well. He learns that his father, Ging Freecss, is a legendary Hunter. Despite the fact that his father abandoned Gon with his relatives in order to pursue his dreams, Gon becomes determined to follow his father's footsteps, pass the Hunter Exam, and eventually find his father to prove himself as a Hunter in his own right.</p>

                        </h1>
                        <p>Gon is an athletic, rustic, and friendly boy who is searching for adventure. Also, he is not very good at math. However, having spent a lot of time in the woods as a child, he is very good with animals. Gon is an Enhancer, who are known for being simple-minded and determined. This determination and talent lead to both potential allies and potential enemies trusting in him and taking his side.</p>

                        </h1>
                        <p>Killua is introduced as a character who appears similar to Gon: cheeky, cheerful, and full of mischievous ideas. However, contrasting Gon's politeness, Killua can be quite rude to others, mostly strangers and older people. He is most commonly known for having a sweet tooth; he loves everything sweet and spent almost 200 million on snacks when he was at the Heavens Arena.</p>

                        </h1>
                        <p>Hisoka is portrayed as entirely self-serving and self-absorbed; he does whatever he likes as long as it pleases him in some way. His insatiable love for spilling the blood of powerful fighters in combat and his enjoyment of extreme pain while doing so fuels his seemingly sadomasochistic desires. In order for them to grow to their full potential (so as to improve the pleasure of killing them later).</p>

                        <p>The Dark Continent is a place that stretches beyond the Known World which is nested inside the gigantic Lake Mobius (located at the center of the Dark Continent). The ancestors of the human race apparently migrated from there to the Known World, as the deciphering of myths and the study of ancient ruins seem to testify. It is speculated that Magical Beasts similarly originated from the Dark Continent.</p>
